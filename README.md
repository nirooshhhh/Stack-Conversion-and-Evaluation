# Stack Visualizer – Expression Converter & Evaluator

## 📌 Overview
Stack Visualizer is a web-based educational tool designed to help users understand stack-based expression **conversion and evaluation**. The application visually demonstrates how stacks operate during **infix, prefix, and postfix** conversions and evaluations, step by step.
It is especially useful for students learning **Data Structures**, as it bridges theory with interactive visualization.

## ✨ Features

* Infix ↔ Postfix ↔ Prefix conversion
* Infix, Prefix, and Postfix evaluation
* Step-by-step stack visualization
* Controls for **Prepare, Play, Pause, Next, Previous, and Reset**
* Clear display of stack state, TOP pointer, and output
* Supports operands as letters (conversion) and numbers (evaluation)

## 🧩 System Architecture

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

  * User input interface
  * Stack and output visualization
* **Backend**: C-based stack processing logic

  * Expression conversion algorithms
  * Expression evaluation using LIFO stack principle

Frontend and backend communicate through structured requests and responses to generate step-wise execution data.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* C (Stack-based algorithms)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters an expression and selects an operation
2. The frontend sends the request to the backend
3. Stack-based algorithms perform conversion or evaluation
4. Each push/pop operation is recorded as a step
5. The frontend visualizes these steps dynamically
6. Final converted expression or evaluated result is displayed

## 🎯 Use Case

* Learning stack operations
* Understanding expression parsing
* Visualizing algorithm execution
* Academic mini-projects and lab demonstrations
